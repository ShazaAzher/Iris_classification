# Iris Classification with Random Forest Classifier

This project demonstrates the implementation of a classifier using the Random Forest algorithm to classify Iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in machine learning and is often used for educational purposes due to its simplicity and clarity.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to predict the species of Iris flowers based on these features. This dataset is widely used for classification tasks and serves as a good starting point for experimenting with different machine learning algorithms.

## Implementation

The implementation is done in Python using the scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library in Python. We use the Random Forest Classifier from scikit-learn's ensemble module to train our model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd iris-classification
```

3. Run the jupyter notebook script:

## Evaluation

The performance of the classifier is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve. These metrics provide insights into how well the classifier performs on the Iris dataset.
